GIT TRACKLINE
Track and show all changes to a specific line of a file in a git repository.

USAGE:
./git-trackline testfile1.txt 2

Add it to your $PATH to run it like this:
git trackline testfile1.txt 2

Sample Output:
--work-- testfile1.txt 2) this might say meooow
2ad18d1e testfile1.txt 2 2) this might say meooow
cf132c79 testfile1.txt 2 2) this says meooow
37649a42 meow.txt 2 2) this says meooooowwwww

Explanation:
  # how it looks in your working directory:
--work-- testfile1.txt 2) this might say meooow

  # the most recent hash of the revision where the file existed
2ad18d1e testfile1.txt 2 2) this might say meooow

  # where it changed before, and what it looked like
cf132c79 testfile1.txt 2 2) this says meooow

  #               v-v---> previous, and current line number of the line.
37649a42 meow.txt 2 2) this says meooooowwwww


What might not work:
Everything. This has no guarantees, but I hope it's useful. :)
